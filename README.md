Neural-Network
==============

Back Propagation Neural Network done in Java with swing UI. This was a proyect for CS 1332 in Georgia Tech and it is
not completely polished. I will hopefully be improving the learning algorithm since I used a quite basic one that lacks
accuracy with large data. I will also be adding functionality to let the Neural Network associate multiple inputs with the
same name to improve its ability to recognize from a larger pool of inputs.

Thanks for giving this a look!
